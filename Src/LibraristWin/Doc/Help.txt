  Calling the program with the "debug" option will activate a debug console that is accessible through the "Debug" menu item under "File".  For example "WinTeoLib debug".

- Debug console.
  The debug console is accessible through the "Debug" menu item under "File".  This menu item is made visible either by using a debug compile version or opening the sofware using the "debug" option such as this: "WinTeoLib debug".  The debug console allows to see tracing output from the code in order to help programming and identify problems.  At any moment, the console can be cleared with the "Clear" button or its output can be saved to a file using the "Save" button.  The console is opened in a non modal way, allowing access to the main program window.
